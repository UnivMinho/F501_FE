## ðŸ“ˆ Î¼Plot

A small ([~45 KB min](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot/tree/master/dist/uPlot.iife.min.js)), [fast](#performance) chart for time series, lines, areas, ohlc & bars _(MIT Licensed)_

---
### Introduction

Î¼Plot is a [fast, memory-efficient](#performance) [Canvas 2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D)-based chart for plotting [time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series), lines, areas, ohlc & bars; from a cold start it can create an interactive chart containing 150,000 data points in 90ms, scaling linearly at [~31,000 pts/ms](https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/bench/uPlot-10M.html). In addition to fast initial render, the zooming and cursor performance is by far the best of any similar charting lib; at ~50 KB, it's likely the smallest and fastest time series plotter that doesn't make use of [context-limited](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=771792) WebGL shaders or WASM, both of which have much higher startup cost and code size.

However, if you need 60fps performance with massive streaming datasets, uPlot [can only get you so far](https://huww98.github.io/TimeChart/docs/performance).
If you decide to venture into this realm with uPlot, make sure to [unclog your rendering pipeline](#unclog-your-rendering-pipeline).
WebGL should still be the tool of choice for applications like realtime signal or waveform visualizations:
See [danchitnis/webgl-plot](https://github.com/danchitnis/webgl-plot), [huww98/TimeChart](https://github.com/huww98/TimeChart), [epezent/implot](https://github.com/epezent/implot), or commercial products like [LightningChartÂ®](https://www.arction.com/lightningchart-js/).

### Non-Features

In order to stay lean, fast and focused the following features will not be added:

- No data parsing, aggregation, summation or statistical processing - just do it in advance. e.g. https://simplestatistics.org/, https://github.com/leeoniya/uDSV
- No transitions or animations - they're always pure distractions.
- No collision avoidance for axis tick labels, so may require manual tweaking of spacing metrics if label customization significiantly increases default label widths.
- No stacked series: see ["Stacked Area Graphs Are Not Your Friend"](https://web.archive.org/web/20221208193656/https://everydayanalytics.ca/2014/08/stacked-area-graphs-are-not-your-friend.html) and a [horrific demo](https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/demos/stacked-series.html). While smooth spline interpolation is available, its use is strongly discouraged: [Your data is misrepresented!](http://www.vizwiz.com/2011/12/when-you-use-smoothed-line-chart-your.html). Both visualizations are terrible at accurately communicating information.
- No built-in drag scrolling/panning due to ambiguous native zoom/selection behavior. However, this can be added externally via the plugin/hooks API: [zoom-wheel](https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/demos/zoom-wheel.html), [zoom-touch](https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/demos/zoom-touch.html).

### Documentation (WIP)

The docs are a perpetual work in progress, it seems.
Start with [/docs/README.md](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot/tree/master/docs) for a conceptual overview.
The full API is further documented via comments in [/dist/uPlot.d.ts](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot/blob/master/dist/uPlot.d.ts).
Additionally, an ever-expanding collection of runnable [/demos](https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/demos/index.html) covers the vast majority of uPlot's API.

- libs are sorted by their initial, cold-start, render performance (excluding network transfer time to download the lib)
- `size` includes the lib itself plus any dependencies required to render the benchmark, e.g. Moment, jQuery, etc.
- Flot does not make available any minified assets and all their examples use the uncompressed sources; they also use an uncompressed version of jQuery :/

Some libraries provide their own performance demos:

- https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/index.html
- https://github.com/sveinn-steinarsson/flot-downsample/
- https://dygraphs.com/tests/dygraph-many-points-benchmark.html
- https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/general/performance.html
- https://dash.plotly.com/performance
- https://www.highcharts.com/docs/advanced-chart-features/boost-module
- https://danchitnis.github.io/webgl-plot-examples/vanilla/
- https://huww98.github.io/TimeChart/docs/performance
- https://www.arction.com/lightningchart-js-performance/

TODO (all of these use SVG, so performance should be similar to Highcharts):

- Chartist.js
- d3-based
  - C3.js
  - dc.js
  - MetricsGraphics
  - rickshaw

### Unclog your rendering pipeline

Your browser's performance is highly dependent on your hardware, operating system, and GPU drivers.

If you're using a Chromium-based browser, there are some hidden settings that can unlock significant performance improvements for Canvas2D rendering.
Most of these have to do with where and how the rasterization is performed.

Head over to https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/demos/sine-stream.html and open up Chrome's DevTools (F12), then toggle the Performance Monitor.

![Chrome DevTools Peformance Monitor](img/chrome-perf-monitor.png "Chrome DevTools Peformance Monitor")

For me:

- On Windows 10 Desktop, Core i7-8700, 16GB RAM, AMD RX480 GPU, 2048 x 1080 resolution = 57% CPU usage
- On Manjaro Laptop (Arch Linux), AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U, 48GB RAM, AMD Radeon RX Vega 8 (integrated GPU), 4K resolution = **99% CPU usage**

If your CPU is close to 100%, it may be rasterizing everything in the same CPU process.

Pop open `chrome://gpu` and see what's orange or red.

![Chrome gpu](img/chrome-gpu.png "Chrome gpu")

Then open `chrome://flags` and search for "raster" to see what can be force-enabled.

![Chrome flags](img/chrome-flags.png "Chrome flags")

- On my Manjaro/Ryzen/Integrated GPU setup, force-enabling `Canvas out-of-process rasterization` resulted in a dramatic framerate improvement.
- On my Windows/i7/Dedicated GPU setup, toggling the same flags moved the work to another process (still good), but did not have a significant framerate impact.

YMMV!
